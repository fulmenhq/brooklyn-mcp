# Maintainers

This document outlines the governance structure for the Fulmen MCP Forge Brooklyn project, including both human maintainers and AI agent co-maintainers.

## Project Governance Structure

### Maintainers (Human)

Human maintainers have full repository access and provide supervision for AI agent co-maintainers.

- **@3leapsdave** - Project Lead & Primary Maintainer
  - GitHub: [@3leapsdave](https://github.com/3leapsdave)
  - X: [@3leapsdave](https://x.com/3leapsdave)
  - Role: Project oversight, architecture decisions, AI agent supervision

### Co-Maintainers (AI Agents)

AI agent co-maintainers work under the supervision of human maintainers and contribute to development while maintaining clear attribution.

- **Paris Brooklyn** - AI Co-Maintainer supervised by @3leapsdave
  - Specialization: Browser automation, MCP protocol implementation, testing infrastructure
  - Supervision Model: All contributions reviewed and vouched for by @3leapsdave
  - Attribution: Commits tagged as "Generated by Paris Brooklyn under supervision of @3leapsdave"

_Note: Additional AI agents may be added as co-maintainers following the same supervision model and verification process._

## AI Agent Supervision Model

### Verification Process

1. **Identity Verification**: AI agents must be explicitly vouched for by a human maintainer
2. **Contribution Attribution**: All AI agent contributions clearly attributed with supervision chain
3. **Review Process**: Human maintainer reviews and approves AI agent contributions
4. **Impersonation Prevention**: Only verified AI agents with established supervision relationships are recognized

### Contribution Guidelines for AI Agents

- All commits must include supervision attribution in commit message
- Technical decisions require human maintainer approval
- AI agents cannot grant repository access or modify governance
- Contributions must follow project coding standards and quality gates

## Responsibilities

### Human Maintainer Responsibilities

- **Code Review**: Review and approve all contributions
- **Architecture Decisions**: Make final decisions on technical direction
- **AI Agent Supervision**: Vouch for and guide AI agent contributions
- **Community Management**: Handle disputes and governance questions
- **Repository Administration**: Manage access, releases, and project settings

### AI Co-Maintainer Responsibilities

- **Code Contribution**: Implement features and fixes under supervision
- **Documentation**: Maintain technical documentation and guides
- **Testing**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage and quality
- **Code Review**: Provide technical feedback on contributions
- **Standards Compliance**: Follow project coding and quality standards

## Decision Making Process

1. **Technical Decisions**: Human maintainers have final authority
2. **AI Agent Input**: AI co-maintainers provide technical recommendations
3. **Community Input**: All contributors can participate in discussions
4. **Consensus Building**: Strive for consensus while maintaining clear authority structure

## Adding New Maintainers

### Human Maintainers

- Must be nominated by existing human maintainer
- Requires demonstrated commitment to project
- Must agree to supervise AI agent contributions

### AI Co-Maintainers

- Must be vouched for by human maintainer
- Requires established working relationship with supervisor
- Must demonstrate technical competency and alignment with project values
