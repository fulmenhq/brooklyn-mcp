# 0.2.2 (Stable Release)

## Highlights

- **Cross-Platform CI/CD**: Achieved full stability across Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows GitHub Actions runners
- **Browser Automation Reliability**: Resolved critical headless browser issues in Windows CI environments
- **Developer Experience**: Streamlined quality gates and validation processes with optimized timeouts
- **Production Ready**: All three platforms pass comprehensive test suites (755+ unit, 104+ integration, 16+ e2e tests)
- **Enterprise Quality**: Zero-tolerance quality gates with automated format, lint, type checking, and full test coverage

## Major Improvements

### Windows CI Compatibility

- Resolved Chromium GPU initialization hangs on headless Windows CI runners
- Configured GPU-disabling flags (`--disable-gpu`, `--disable-software-rasterizer`, `--disable-gpu-compositing`)
- Added Windows-specific browser launch args for stable headless operation
- Implemented platform-aware timeout configuration (Windows needs 240s vs 15s for browser operations)

### Browser Process Management

- Replaced unreliable `Promise.race()` pattern with controlled timeout mechanism
- Implemented proper browser instance cleanup with force-kill capabilities
- Added zombie process detection and cleanup utilities
- Enhanced error handling for browser process termination across platforms

### Cross-Platform Infrastructure

- Added `.gitattributes` for consistent line endings across Windows/Unix systems
- Installed Windows build dependencies (Scoop, zip, shasum) in CI environment
- Unified precommit test configuration with platform-aware timeouts
- Enforced single fork execution on Windows CI to prevent browser process deadlocks

### Developer Experience

- Comprehensive pre-push validation with format, typecheck, lint, and full test suite
- File-level quality validation tools (`bun run check:file`, `bun run check:file:fix`)
- Release validation script covering all quality gates, builds, and license compliance
- Cross-platform build and packaging for 6 target platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows × x64, ARM64)

## Changes

### Fixed

- Headless Windows CI hang due to Chromium GPU initialization
- Windows test timeouts causing pre-push validation failures
- Browser process deadlocks from Promise.race() cleanup patterns
- Windows-specific path handling in test suites
- Line ending inconsistencies across development platforms
- Missing Windows build tools (zip, shasum) in CI environment

### Enhanced

- Vitest configuration with platform-aware timeouts and fork management
- Browser factory with Windows-specific Chromium launch arguments
- Process manager with cross-platform termination and cleanup
- Release workflow with comprehensive validation and artifact upload
- MCP schema compliance validation for 72 browser automation tools
- HTTP mode integration with OAuth endpoints and team isolation

### Technical

- **Browser Flags**: Added `--headless=new` for stable Windows headless mode
- **Timeout Configuration**: Aligned precommit config with main (240s for Windows browser operations)
- **Fork Management**: Single fork execution on Windows CI prevents parallel test deadlocks
- **Resource Cleanup**: Controlled timeout mechanism actively kills browser processes on failure
- **Build Tools**: Scoop package manager installation for Windows GitHub Actions runners

## Breaking Changes

- None. This is a stabilization release maintaining full backward compatibility with 0.2.x APIs.

## Known Issues

- None. All known issues from RC releases have been resolved.

## Test Coverage

### Quality Metrics

- **Unit Tests**: 755 passed, 13 skipped (757 total)
- **Integration Tests**: 104 passed, 10 skipped (114 total)
- **E2E Tests**: 16 passed, 14 skipped (30 total)
- **Total**: 875 passed, 37 skipped (901 total test cases)
- **Platforms**: Ubuntu 22.04, macOS 14, Windows Server 2022 (all passing)

### Quality Gates

## Distribution

### Binary Artifacts

- Tags `v0.2.2` trigger GitHub Actions to build and upload binaries
- Platforms: Linux (x64, ARM64), macOS (x64, ARM64), Windows (x64, ARM64)
- Formats: `.zip`, `.tar.gz` with SHA256 checksums
- License compliance: `licenses.json` and `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` included

### Installation

```bash

# https://github.com/fulmenhq/brooklyn-mcp/releases/tag/v0.2.2

# Linux/macOS
chmod +x brooklyn-<platform>-<arch>
./brooklyn-<platform>-<arch> --version

# Verify integrity
shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS_<platform>_<arch>.txt
```

### MCP Integration

```bash
# Add Brooklyn to Claude Code (project-specific)
claude mcp add brooklyn brooklyn mcp start

# Add Brooklyn globally (all projects)
claude mcp add -s user brooklyn brooklyn mcp start

# Verify configuration
claude mcp list
claude mcp get brooklyn
```

## NPM Registry (Future Release)

- Scope: `@fulmenhq/brooklyn-mcp`

- Features: Binary download on install, opt-in self-update flow
- Timeline: Targeted for 0.3.0 release

## Roadmap

### Near-term (0.2.x patch releases)

- Enhanced documentation for team-specific configurations
- Additional browser automation tools and capabilities
- Performance optimizations for large-scale browser pools

### Mid-term (0.3.0)

- NPM registry distribution with platform-specific packages
- Self-update mechanism with signed artifact verification
- Enhanced telemetry and monitoring capabilities
- Advanced CSS analysis and layout debugging tools

### Long-term (2.0.0)

- Multi-team browser pool orchestration
- Advanced security features (team isolation, resource quotas)
- Enterprise deployment patterns and scaling guides
- Comprehensive plugin ecosystem for team-specific needs

## Acknowledgments

This release represents the culmination of extensive cross-platform testing and fixes across 18 release candidates (rc.1 through rc.18), establishing Brooklyn MCP as a truly enterprise-ready, cross-platform browser automation solution.

Special recognition for the DX improvements that enable CI/CD pipeline stability across all platforms, ensuring developers can confidently build, test, and deploy Brooklyn-powered automation.

## Migration from RC Releases

If you're upgrading from any 0.2.2-rc.x version:

1. **No breaking changes** - All RC APIs remain stable
2. **Update version references** - Replace `v0.2.2-rc.*` with `v0.2.2`
3. **Verify MCP configuration** - Run `claude mcp get brooklyn` to confirm setup
4. **Test your workflows** - All existing browser automation should work unchanged
