# Brooklyn MCP v0.3.4 Release Notes

**Date**: February 2026
**Tag**: `v0.3.4`
**Theme**: _Windows Support & Standalone Binaries_ - Real executables, native matrix builds

## Headline

v0.3.3 release assets were ~3MB JavaScript bundles that required Bun installed to run. v0.3.4 fixes this: every platform now gets a standalone compiled binary (~60-120MB) that runs with zero runtime dependencies.

**Before**: Download binary, run it, get "bun: command not found".
**After**: Download binary, run it, it works.

## What Changed

### Standalone Compiled Binaries

All release binaries are now built with `bun build --compile`, producing self-contained executables:

- **Linux x64/ARM64**: ELF executables
- **macOS ARM64**: Mach-O arm64 executables
- **Windows x64/ARM64**: PE32+ executables

No Bun, no Node.js, no runtime required.

### Native Matrix Builds

The release pipeline now runs 5 parallel build jobs, each on its native platform:

| Platform      | Runner                 | Binary                       |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Linux x64     | ubuntu-latest          | brooklyn-linux-amd64         |
| Linux ARM64   | ubuntu-latest-arm64-s  | brooklyn-linux-arm64         |
| macOS ARM64   | macos-15               | brooklyn-darwin-arm64        |
| Windows x64   | windows-latest         | brooklyn-windows-amd64.exe   |
| Windows ARM64 | windows-latest-arm64-s | brooklyn-windows-arm64.exe   |

A `collect` job then merges all artifacts, generates checksums, and creates the draft release.

### Darwin Intel Dropped

macOS Intel (x64) is no longer built or tested. Apple Silicon (ARM64) is the only supported macOS architecture.

### Windows Browser Detection Fix

Playwright 1.57+ changed the Chrome directory from `chrome-win` to `chrome-win64` on Windows. The browser setup script now handles both layouts.

### Test Isolation

`BROOKLYN_TEST_MODE=true` prevents integration tests from interfering with the developer's running MCP server. Tests no longer kill external Brooklyn processes.

### Formatter Scope Fix

Prettier is now scoped to markdown, JSON, and HTML only. This resolves conflicts with yamllint's double-space inline comment requirement in YAML files.

## Upgrade

```
bun upgrade
git pull origin main
bun install
bun run check-all
bun run build:local  # Build standalone binary
```

## Platform Support

| Platform | Architecture | Status       |

| Linux    | ARM64        | Supported    |
| macOS    | ARM64        | Supported    |
| Windows  | x64          | Supported    |
| Windows  | ARM64        | Supported    |
| macOS    | x64 (Intel)  | Dropped      |
