# Fulmen Agentic Attribution Standard

**Standard**: Consistent attribution format for AI agent contributions to ensure
transparency, accountability, and proper tracking in the fulmen ecosystem,
following Fulmen Ecosystem Standards.

## 🎯 Purpose

Establish clear attribution patterns for Fulmen to enable:

- **Transparency** - Full visibility into AI agent contributions and
  collaborative development
- **Accountability** - Clear human supervision and responsibility chains
- **Technical Traceability** - Interface-specific issue diagnosis and debugging
- **Quality Assurance** - Consistent standards following Fulmen ecosystem
  patterns

## 📋 Attribution Format

### Standard Pattern

**Commit Message Format**:

```

## 📚 Examples

### Standard Feature Implementation

```
feat: add document metadata extraction

Implement comprehensive metadata extraction for document analysis
pipeline with support for title, description, and custom fields.

🎯 Changes:
- Add Metadata struct with configurable fields
- Implement extractMetadata function with markdown parsing
- Add metadata validation and sanitization
- Enhance output formats with metadata display

📊 Coverage: 78.1% (+2.3% improvement)
🛡️ Security: Input sanitization for all metadata fields

🏗️ Nova Prime
```

### Bug Fix with Multi-Agent

```
fix: resolve content analysis showing zero values

Content analysis was being cleared by security feature - remove
automatic clearing to show analysis by default for transparency.

🎯 Root Cause: Security feature clearing content by default
🔧 Solution: Modified security logic to preserve content analysis
📊 Testing: Integration tests confirm fix working
