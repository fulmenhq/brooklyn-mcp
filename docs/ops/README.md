# Operations Index

This directory mirrors Fulmen ecosystem patterns (see goneat). Subfolders group SOPs and decisions by concern:

- repository/ – governance, versioning decisions, contribution processes
- release/ – packaging, artifacts, distribution pipelines
- security/ – security posture, scanning, disclosures
- compliance/ – policies and audit trails
- infrastructure/ – CI/CD, build runners, environments
- dependencies/ – third‑party management and pinning
- templates/ – issue/PR/release and document templates

Phase markers at repo root:

- `LIFECYCLE_PHASE` and `RELEASE_PHASE` guide policies and CI thresholds.
