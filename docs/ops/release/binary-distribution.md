# Release SOP: Binary Distribution

This SOP packages the `brooklyn` CLI as cross‑platform bundles and publishes them to a GitHub Release. Mirrors goneat’s process with Bun/TypeScript specifics.

Preconditions

- `bun run check-all` passes
- Version set via scripts (e.g., `0.2.0-rc.1`)
- Tag planned (e.g., `v0.2.0-rc.1`)

Local Build (optional)

```bash
bun install
bun run build:legacy   # produces dist/brooklyn (ESBuild single-file CLI)
```

Artifacts

- Archives per OS/arch: `brooklyn-<os>-<arch>.(zip|tar.gz)`
- Checksums: `SHA256SUMS`

CI Workflow

- `.github/workflows/release.yml` builds on annotated tag push and attaches artifacts to GitHub Release.

Package Managers (optional, future)

- Homebrew tap: `fulmenhq/tap` formula for macOS/Linux
- Scoop bucket: `fulmenhq/scoop-bucket` for Windows
- AUR (optional): `brooklyn-mcp-bin`

Rollback

- Delete the GitHub Release and tag, re‑tag with corrected artifacts
