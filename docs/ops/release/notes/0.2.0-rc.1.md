# 0.2.0-rc.1 (Public RC)

Highlights

- Version reset to 0.2.x for public onboarding (see repository/version-reset-2025-09.md)
- MCP HTTP OAuth endpoints stabilized and integration tests added
- Codex MCP configuration: TOML serialization fix for ~/.codex/config.toml
- Test infrastructure stabilized (vitest forks pool, global stub cleanup)
- Operations documentation reorganized under docs/ops/ (repository, release, security, etc.)
- Phase markers (LIFECYCLE_PHASE, RELEASE_PHASE) validated by schema
- Release workflow added: builds and attaches cross‑platform artifacts to GitHub Releases

Changes

- config: Correct TOML serialization for Codex MCP
- cli: Add Cline stdio suggestion in doctor
- tests: Add phase marker tests, make version tests RC-aware
- docs: Reorg ops and make version reset doc authoritative

Breaking Changes

- None expected; still in 0.x (APIs may evolve). Any changes will be called out explicitly.

Known Issues

- Some browser-intensive tests are skipped in CI until runner provisioning is finalized.
- Asset processing logs contain failure entries during mocked paths (expected in tests).

Distribution

- Tags `v0.2.0-rc.1` trigger GitHub Actions to build and upload binaries.
- Artifacts: `brooklyn-<os>-<arch>.(zip|tar.gz)` + `SHA256SUMS_*`.

NPM Registry (planned for next RC)

- Scope: `@fulmenhq/brooklyn-mcp`.
- Approach: a small wrapper package that downloads the correct binary on install, or per‑platform packages (e.g., `@fulmenhq/brooklyn-mcp-darwin-arm64`).
- Will include an opt‑in self‑update flow.

Roadmap

- RC2+: npm packaging, telemetry hardening, and additional integration suites
- GA 0.2.0: finalize distrib + docs, validate with early adopters
- 2.0 GA target: add `brooklyn self-update` with signed artifact verification and rollback
