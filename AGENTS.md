# AGENTS.md: Guidelines for Agentic Coding in fulmen-mcp-forge-brooklyn

## Project Overview

Brooklyn is a multi-team MCP server for browser automation using Bun, TypeScript, and Playwright. Follow fulmen ecosystem standards in docs/fulmen/.

## Build/Lint/Test Commands

- Build: bun run build
- Lint: bun run lint
- Typecheck: bun run typecheck
- Test all: bun run test (vitest - NEVER bun test)
- Test single file: bun run test path/to/test.ts
- Test specific test: bun run test -t "test name"
- Format: bun run format:code
- File check: bun run check:file path/to/file.ts (mandatory after edits)
- Check all: bun run check-all (run before commits)

## AI Agent Commit Attribution

AI agent commits should use this format:

```
Generated by [AI Agent Name] under supervision of @[human-maintainer]

Co-Authored-By: [AI Agent Name] <noreply@fulmen.ai>
```

Example:

```
Generated by Paris Brooklyn under supervision of @3leapsdave

Co-Authored-By: Paris Brooklyn <noreply@fulmen.ai>
```

## Code Style Guidelines

- **Imports**: Node built-ins → Third-party → Local (blank lines); use `import type`; absolute paths
- **Formatting**: Biome & Prettier; double quotes for strings, backticks for templates only
- **Types**: Strict TS; NO `any` (use unknown); optional chaining over !; Promise<Return | undefined>
- **Naming**: camelCase vars/functions, PascalCase classes/types; \_ for unused params
- **Error Handling**: Structured logging; try-catch for async; no silent failures; error boundaries
- **General**: Template literals; process.env["VAR"]; single responsibility; JSDoc for APIs
- **Testing**: AAA pattern; independent tests; 80%+ coverage; proper mocks; vitest only
- **Security**: Domain validation, rate limiting, team isolation
- **Cursor/Copilot Rules**: None found - follow above standards

## Development Standards

- Source-first: Review existing code before changes
- Pattern consistency: Follow codebase patterns
- Quality gates: All checks must pass; no bypassing
- MCP Compliance: Strict protocol adherence
- Resource Mgmt: Browser pooling, cleanup

**Note**: Read source first, run quality gates before commits. See docs/substaile/codex/ for details. For onboarding, see CLAUDE.md.
