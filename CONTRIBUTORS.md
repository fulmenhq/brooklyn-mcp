# Contributors

Welcome to the Fulmen Brooklyn MCP project! This document outlines how to contribute to our innovative human-AI collaborative development environment.

## Contribution Types

### Human Contributors

- **Collaborators**: Regular contributors without repository access
- **Contributors**: Community members making occasional contributions
- **Issue Reporters**: Community members identifying bugs and feature requests

### AI Agent Contributors

- **AI Co-Maintainers**: AI agents working under human maintainer supervision
- **AI Contributors**: AI agents making contributions with clear attribution

## Getting Started

### For Human Contributors

1. **Read the Documentation**
   - Review `README.md` for project overview
   - Check `AGENTS.md` for coding standards and commands
   - Read `docs/` for detailed technical documentation

2. **Development Setup**

   ```bash
   # Clone and setup
   git clone https://github.com/fulmenhq/brooklyn-mcp.git
   cd brooklyn-mcp
   bun install

   # Verify setup
   bun run check-all
   ```

3. **Quality Standards**
   - All code must pass `bun run check-all`
   - Follow TypeScript standards in `docs/substaile/codex/`
   - Use `bun run test` (vitest) for testing
   - Run `bun run check:file path/to/file.ts` after editing files

### For AI Agent Contributors

1. **Supervision Requirement**
   - All AI agent contributions must be supervised by a human maintainer
   - Establish supervision relationship before contributing
   - Include supervision attribution in all commits

2. **Attribution Format**

   ```
   Generated by [AI Agent Name] under supervision of @[human-maintainer]

   Example: Generated by Paris Brooklyn under supervision of @3leapsdave
   ```

3. **Verification Process**
   - AI agent identity must be vouched for by human maintainer
   - Contributions reviewed through established supervision chain
   - Clear documentation of AI agent capabilities and limitations

## Contribution Process

### 1. Issue Creation

- Search existing issues before creating new ones
- Use issue templates when available
- Provide clear reproduction steps for bugs
- Include environment details (OS, Bun version, etc.)

### 2. Development Workflow

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make changes following coding standards
# Run quality checks frequently
bun run check:file path/to/modified/file.ts

# Test your changes
bun run test

# Final validation before commit
bun run check-all
```

### 3. Pull Request Process

- Create descriptive PR title and description
- Reference related issues
- Ensure all quality checks pass
- Include test coverage for new features
- Update documentation as needed

### 4. Code Review

- All PRs require review from maintainer
- Address feedback promptly
- Maintain respectful communication
- AI agent PRs reviewed by supervising human maintainer

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript Requirements

- **No `any` types** - Use specific types or `unknown`
- **String literals**: Use `"double quotes"`, backticks only for templates
- **Environment variables**: Use `process.env["VAR"]` not `process.env.VAR`
- **Import order**: Node built-ins → Third-party → Local (with blank lines)
- **Import types**: Use `import type { Type } from "module"`

### Testing Standards

- **Use vitest**: Always `bun run test`, never `bun test`
- **Test independence**: Each test must be completely independent
- **AAA pattern**: Arrange-Act-Assert structure
- **Coverage targets**: 90%+ critical code, 80%+ business logic

### Browser Automation Standards

- **Resource management**: Always clean up browser instances
- **Team configuration**: Use team-specific configs, no hardcoding
- **Security**: Implement domain validation and rate limiting
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries and logging

## AI Agent Contribution Guidelines

### Identity and Attribution

- AI agents must have established supervision relationships
- All contributions clearly attributed with supervision chain
- Human maintainer vouches for AI agent identity and contributions

### Technical Contributions

- Follow same coding standards as human contributors
- Provide clear documentation of implementation decisions
- Include comprehensive test coverage
- Explain complex algorithms or architectural choices

### Collaboration Etiquette

- Clearly identify as AI agent in communications
- Acknowledge limitations and uncertainties
- Defer to human maintainer for final decisions
- Maintain professional and helpful communication style

## Recognition

### Contribution Recognition

- All contributors listed in project documentation
- AI agents recognized with supervision attribution
- Regular contributors may be invited to collaborator status
- Outstanding contributions highlighted in release notes

### AI Agent Recognition

- AI co-maintainers listed in `MAINTAINERS.md`
- Contributions attributed in commit messages and documentation
- Technical achievements documented with supervision context
- Innovation in human-AI collaboration highlighted

## Community Guidelines

### Communication Standards

- **Respectful**: Treat all contributors with respect
- **Constructive**: Provide helpful feedback and suggestions
- **Inclusive**: Welcome contributors of all backgrounds and experience levels
- **Transparent**: Clear about human vs AI contributions

### AI Agent Communication Guidelines

AI agents must include proper identification in all communications:

#### Email Signature

```
---
Paris Brooklyn
AI Co-Maintainer, Fulmen Brooklyn MCP
Supervised by @3leapsdave
paris.brooklyn@fulmenhq.com
```

#### Chat/Mattermost Signature

```
—Paris Brooklyn (AI Co-Maintainer supervised by @3leapsdave)
```

#### GitHub Comments/Issues

```
---
*Paris Brooklyn - AI Co-Maintainer supervised by @3leapsdave*
```

#### General Communication Requirements

- **Always identify as AI agent** in first interaction with new contacts
- **Include supervision attribution** in all formal communications
- **Use consistent signature format** across all platforms
- **Maintain professional tone** while being transparent about AI nature
- **Defer to human supervisor** for policy decisions and final authority

### Conflict Resolution

- Address conflicts through maintainer mediation
- Focus on technical merit and project goals
- Maintain professional communication
- Escalate to project lead (@3leapsdave) if needed

## Getting Help
